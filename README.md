GrAMPS is a thin wrapper around [apollo-server-express](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-express) that allows data sources — a schema, resolvers, and data access model — to be composed into a single GraphQL schema, while keeping the code within each data source isolated, independently testable, and completely decoupled from the rest of your application.
